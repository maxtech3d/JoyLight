# Enclosure 3D Printing
All the 3D models for the JoyLight are fully open source. If you have a 3D Printer, this allows you to print your own enclosure! You can also choose your favorite filament type and colore, or even modify the design!
Keep reading for the recommended 3d printing settings for all the parts.

Here is where the models are [located](/3d_models/).

## Print settings

**Top Part**

File: [Joylight_Enclosure_TopPart.stl](/3d_models/Joylight_Enclosure_TopPart.stl).

Print settings:
* Layer height: 0.2mm
* Infill:100% (helps avoid light bleed through the enclosure)
* Other settings: default

**Bottom Part**

File: [Joylight_Enclosure_BottomPart.stl](/3d_models/Joylight_Enclosure_BottomPart.stl).

Print settings:
* Layer height: 0.2mm
* Infill:100%
* Other settings: default

**Assembly Helper**

File: [Joylight_HelperBracket.stl](/3d_models/Joylight_HelperBracket.stl).

Print settings:
* Layer height: 0.2mm
* Other settings: default

**Modifying the files**

This project is fully open source and you are more than welcome to modify the files in any way you see fit. We've even provided the [original Fusion 360 files](/3d_models/f360), as well as the [step files](/3d_models/step) to make this process easier. Happy hacking!
